This is **TextLog**, a minimalist Jekyll theme created by [Heiswayi Nrird](http://heiswayi.github.io). TextLog has a quite simple homepage; a theme with a brief introduction text (about the blog itself or the author bio) and then goes a list of written article/post titles. TextLog typeface is using [Droid Sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Droid+Sans) from Google Web Font. Droid Sans is one of the best web fonts in the world for highest readability. TextLog [source code](https://github.com/heiswayi/textlog) is licensed under [MIT License](http://heiswayi.github.io/mit-license).

TextLog post layout contains following structures:

- a small link back to homepage (&larr; Index)
- the post title
- the post metadata such as date, author name and clickable post tags
- the post content
- a link back to top of the page
- [Disqus comment](https://disqus.com/) if enabled

Please note that the post content does not have fixed width. The browser size is the `max-width` of the content with `1rem` unit of margin. This intention to give a maximum visibility to the content reading. However, TextLog is responsive and mobile friendly, so the image or text will be automatically resized or wrapped as the browser window size is adjusted. Happy blogging!
